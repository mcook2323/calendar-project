# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

This project is a live time calendar that displays time blocks for each hour running from 9AM to 5PM. Each time block has a text area that allows you to save information to your local storage and reuse upon reload of the screen. The timeblocks are also represented by three colors: Grey for past hours, red for the current hour, and green for future hours. The calendar also has a live time presented at the top of the page.
